This github is hosting Nerdlabs binaries.
This are what we are using on the pool explorers ect it saves us time later.
Please note this is not an official repo or affiliation for any of these project. 
Its more efficient for us to build once and shore here for our use and the communities.
We will NOT be archiving old builds. All pushes are current (AT THE TIME OF PUSH).
This github is for our efficanty and to help those who are having a difficult time 
Building binaries for themselves. Its is NOT representative of absolute current builds.
Using someone else's binary has inherent risk. 
For this reason submissions not built by Nerdlabs staff or peers Are not permitted. 
If you need something compiled please see us at Crypto-city or on our discord.
